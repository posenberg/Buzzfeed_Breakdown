Problem Solving with Twitter API
================================

I saw a question on quora: "How does Buzzfeed pick their numbers?"
The asker answered his own question by using the Twitter API to show which numbers were used the most. He provided a high level explanation on how he came up with his answer without going into detail about much code. I decided to deconstruct the coding process by using python. You can see my blog post [here](http://strangedata.ghost.io/2014/08/18/problem-solving-with-python-and-twitter-api/)

####Buzzfeed Directory:   
I created functions to authenticate, save tweets, clean up its information and generate a graph.

####Buzzfeed-OOP Directory:  
I need more practice with creating classes, so I classed it out and now you can pass a filename and the number of tweets as arguments and it instantly generates a graph.
